so if the backend was to be built how many models, routes and controllers will be needed to create it
ChatGPT said:
If you're building the backend for a full medical organization application, the number of models, routes, and controllers will depend on the complexity of the system. Here's a breakdown of the essential parts:

1. Models (Database Schema)üßë‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª
The backend will need multiple models to represent different entities in the system. Here are the core models:

1.1 User Models
Admin (Manages the system)
Doctor (Handles consultations, prescriptions, and diagnoses)
Nurse (Assists doctors, manages in-patient care)
Receptionist (Schedules appointments, handles patient registration)
Patient (Receives healthcare services)
Pharmacist (Dispenses medications)
Lab Technician (Handles test reports)
1.2 Medical Records
Patient Profile (Personal details, history, insurance)
Electronic Health Record (EHR) (Medical history, allergies, test results)
Appointment (Doctor-patient scheduling)
Prescription (Doctor-issued medications)
Diagnosis (Doctor‚Äôs notes and medical conditions)
1.3 Hospital Management
Room (Hospital rooms for admitted patients)
Bed (Availability of hospital beds)
Inventory (Medical supplies, pharmaceuticals)
Staff Schedule (Shift management)
1.4 Financial & Billing
Invoice (Billing details for services)
Payment (Tracking payments)
Insurance Claim (Processing insurance coverage)
1.5 Laboratory & Pharmacy
Test Request (Doctor‚Äôs order for lab tests)
Test Report (Lab results)
Medicine (Pharmacy inventory)
Order (Medicine purchases by patients)
1.6 Security & Authentication
Role (Admin, Doctor, Patient, etc.)
Permissions (Access control)



2. Routes
Each model requires a set of API routes to interact with the frontend. Here‚Äôs how the routes will be structured:

2.1 Authentication & User Routes
